    "Here are 3 distinct practical use cases for a global store with Immutable.js in a JavaScript application, inspired by Redux, where it would be most beneficial:
**Complex Form Management and Validation:**

**Scenario:*
Imagine a multi-step form with dozens of fields, potentially spread across different components. The form requires complex validation rules that depend on multiple field values. Data entered in one step might affect the available options or validation requirements in subsequent steps.

**Why a Global Store is a Good Fit:**
**Centralized State:*
A global store provides a single source of truth for all form data. Components don't need to pass data back and forth or manage their own individual form state, simplifying component logic.

**Simplified Validation:*
Validation logic can be implemented as middleware or selectors within the store. These can react to any form input change and update validation errors, disabled fields, or other derived state in a consistent and predictable manner. Immutable.js ensures that components only re-render when the relevant parts of the form data actually change, improving performance.

**Undo/Redo Functionality:*
With Immutable.js, every state update creates a new immutable state object. This makes implementing undo/redo functionality straightforward. You can easily maintain a history of state changes and revert to previous states without worrying about unintended side effects.

**Asynchronous Operations:*
If the form needs to interact with an API (e.g., checking username availability), actions can be dispatched to handle the asynchronous requests and update the store accordingly, ensuring data consistency across the application.

**Real-Time Data Visualization and Dashboarding:**

**Scenario:*
A dashboard displays multiple charts and graphs that visualize data coming from a real-time source, such as a WebSocket connection. The data updates frequently, and different components need to react to these updates.

**Why a Global Store is a Good Fit:**
**Efficient Updates:*
The global store becomes the central hub for the real-time data. When new data arrives, an action is dispatched to update the store. Immutable.js allows components to selectively re-render only when the specific data they're displaying changes, avoiding unnecessary re-renders and improving performance. This is crucial for smooth real-time visualizations.

**Data Transformation and Aggregation:*
Selectors can be used to derive aggregated data or perform transformations on the raw data before it's displayed in the charts. This keeps the components focused solely on rendering the data.

**Consistent Data View:*
All components access the data through the global store, ensuring a consistent view of the data regardless of when they were rendered.

**Time-Travel Debugging:*
The ability to inspect previous states is valuable for debugging real-time data streams.

**User Interface with Complex Interactions and State Dependencies:**

**Scenario:*
A user interface (UI) contains multiple interacting components where a change in one component's state can have cascading effects on other components. For example, selecting a filter in one section might update the available options in another section and trigger a change in the displayed results.

**Why a Global Store is a Good Fit:**
**Decoupled Components:*
The global store allows components to be decoupled from each other. They communicate through actions and selectors, rather than direct dependencies. This makes the UI more modular, testable, and maintainable.

**Predictable State Management:*
Actions clearly define the user's intent and the reducers predictably update the state based on these actions. This makes the application state easier to reason about and debug.

**Complex State Derivation:*
Selectors are perfect for deriving complex state from the core state. For instance, based on the selected filters, you might need to calculate the subset of data to display or the available options in a dropdown. Selectors can efficiently recompute this derived state only when the relevant input data changes, thanks to memoization.

**Simplified Side Effects:*
Actions can trigger side effects (e.g., API calls) through middleware (e.g., Redux Thunk). This keeps the reducers pure and the component logic focused on rendering. When side effects complete, they dispatch further actions to update the store, ensuring a consistent and predictable flow of data."
